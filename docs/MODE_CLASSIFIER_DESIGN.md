# Mode Classifier Design (Archived Legacy)

## Status

Archived.

This document describes a separate analyzer concept (`Key Detector`) and does not align with the current `genx_delay` plugin deliverable.

## Current Project Scope

`genx_delay` is a delay effect plugin; active requirements and release criteria are tracked in:

1. `docs/GENX_DELAY_MVP_KANBAN.md`
2. `docs/GENX_DELAY_GUI_DESIGN.md`
3. `docs/VST_GUI_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md`

## Note

The previous content is intentionally removed from active docs to keep the repository focused and reduce planning ambiguity.
